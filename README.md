## ðŸš€ How the model works

Our app offers an advanced image classification model designed to recognize 27 different skin diseases accurately. Our deep learning model is trained on a vast and diverse dataset of skin images sourced from multiple trusted providers to ensure the highest level of accuracy and reliability.

With just a simple upload of an image of their skin, users can easily get an instant prediction of the most likely skin disease category that the image belongs to, along with a confidence score indicating the reliability of the prediction. Our app offers an intuitive user interface that provides detailed information about the predicted skin disease category, including symptoms, treatment options, and other relevant details.

Our image classification model is constantly evolving and improving. We regularly update our deep learning algorithm with the latest data to ensure the highest level of accuracy and keep up with emerging skin diseases. Our app offers a reliable and convenient way for individuals to monitor their skin health and stay informed about potential skin diseases.

## ðŸ§¬ About EMB IEEE Student Chapter AUTH

EMB IEEE Student Chapter AUTH, currently the largest EMB student chapter in Greece, is an interdisciplinary team of students coming from various backgrounds related to engineering and life sciences with the vision to promote the field of biomedical engineering in the student community.

We aim to give the stimuli needed for students to understand and better engage with bioengineering technologies outside their facultyâ€™s curriculum. We achieve this through a variety of scientific, technical, and educational activities that include, among others, lectures and workshops in which participants learn to apply the concepts and methods of physical and engineering sciences in biology and medicine while expanding their spectrum of knowledge. These events are also an effort to bridge the gap between academia and professionals, create networking opportunities for students, and get them acquainted with emerging technologies that will influence future advances in biomedical engineering and healthcare technology.

Furthermore, students can challenge themselves and test their abilities in hackathons and competitions, learn to cooperate, be part of interdisciplinary teams, and get inspired to innovate. Our mission is, therefore, to provide our members and the entire studentsâ€™ community with access to the people, practices, information, ideas, and opinions that are shaping one of the fastest-growing fields in science!
